# E-Voting-System
This project is a simple yet complete E-Voting System built in C using structures, file handling, and a modular design. It features a real-world voting platform where voters can register, log in, cast a single vote, and view the election results. All data such as voter records, candidates, and vote counts is stored permanently using text files.
